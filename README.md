# sdst_results

Here we provide the benchmark and the results from the paper "Decomposition-based Local Search for Multi-objective Permutation Flowshop Schedling with Sequence Dependent Setup Times".

We have dealt with the minimization of makespan and total weighted tardiness.

The benchark is also available at the original repository at http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances

The results are in the form of approximated Pareto Fronts. They were obtained by the proposed algorithm, called MOLS/D, according to 10 runs x 220 instances, after 10000n evaluations, where n is the number of jobs of the instance. Totalizing 2200 files of results.
