Here we provide the the results from the paper M. Zangari, A. Constantino and J. Ceberio (2018) "Decomposition-based Local Search for Multi-objective Permutation Flowshop Schedling with Sequence Dependent Setup Times". In Proocedings of the Conference on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

We have dealt with the minimization of makespan and total weighted tardiness.

The benchark is available at the author's repository at http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances. The referenced paper from this benchmark is M. Ciavotta, G. Minella and R. Ruiz, (2013). Multi-objective sequence dependent setup times flowshop scheduling: a new algorithm and a comprehensive study. European Journal of Operational Research, 227(2), 301-313.

The results are in the form of approximated Pareto Fronts. They were obtained by the proposed algorithm, called MOLS/D, according to 10 runs x 220 instances, after 10000n evaluations, where n is the number of jobs of the instances. Totalizing 2200 files of results.
